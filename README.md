This crate provides a Rust interface to the Bitcoin JSON-RPC API.

It is currently work-in-progress as not all RPC calls are implemented.

## Features

- Does not use macros
- Automatic retry mechanism if bitcoin-core is not yet ready
- Provides trait of all RPC methods for easy mocking (`BitcoinRpcApi`)

## Usage

Check `examples/` but basically, given a URL and the username/password for the node, you can construct a client and call the desired RPC method.
